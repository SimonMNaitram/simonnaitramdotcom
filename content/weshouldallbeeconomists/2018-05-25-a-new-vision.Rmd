Does a new government represent a new beginning? I have no idea. I am sure however, that a new government represents a new chance to do things right.

**We need a new vision.** How do we see ourselves in 10 years? Go on, imagine what life will be like. Close your eyes, think of what you want for yourself, your family, your people, your country. 

Now open your eyes. How do we get there? What can you do today or tomorrow that is a step in that direction? What does that bright new world look like? 

Let's build a modern economy for ourselves. Throw away the fear of change. Resist the temptation to get ahead at someone else's expense. Consider how each person close to you might be affected by your actions.

It is time for a dramatic overhaul. Let's not just change the curtains and paint the door. Let's refurbish the whole house.

Without an opposition, a new government can change things quickly. Without an opposition, we must become the voice that shapes the way Barbados evolves.
