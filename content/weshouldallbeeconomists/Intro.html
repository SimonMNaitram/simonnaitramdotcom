<p>This blog is titled <strong>We Should All Be Economists</strong> because its purpose is to help you become an economist. Not a full-fledged practicing economist, but an engaged citizen who can discuss the merits of government policies and personal actions. This blog is to help you understand the silly economicky world around us, in real time.</p>
<p><strong>We Should All Be Economists</strong> is driven by the idea that a more engaged, informed, and active society leads to better economic outcomes. We live in a world where our actions and choices affect real economic outcomes that in turn influence the quality of our lives. Understanding, as a society, what is at stake in every decision can only improve our collective livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>This blog is firstly for non-economists.</strong> A few months ago a friend, who I consider to be one of the smartest people Iâ€™ve met, related her struggle with economics to me. As a non-economist, no matter how carefully she reads, how closely she listens, how dedicatedly she engages, she still cannot wrap her head around the broad economic debate. This blog is written for her, for my friends, for my family, and for all non-economists who might feel the debate is beyond them.</p>
<p><strong>This blog is also for economists.</strong> What I say here will be founded on first principles. I pride myself on The Big Picture. I promise to be thoughtful in identifying the economic mechanisms most relevant to any subject, and focus on the core of any argument. Hopefully, if you are a policymaker, academic, or student reading this blog, you will be encouraged to engage with the key concerns affecting our societies.</p>
<p>In economics there are rarely any absolute rights or wrongs; this is not religion. The core of economics is identifying, understanding, and quantifying the trade-offs of any action. Expect few judgements, but much balancing of scales.</p>
<p>I welcome comments; engagement is the aim. I welcome suggestions; tell me what you would like to understand. I welcome criticism; I am here to grow as well. I sincerely ask you to refrain from rude behaviour or bullying.</p>
<p>And I patiently await the day that <strong>We Are All Economists</strong>.</p>
