The first thing everyone wants to talk about when discussing Barbados' problems is the government's debt. Debt is fashionable. It's easy to understand, and easy to blame. But is debt really the problem? 

You'll probably guess that I'm about to say no. Debt is a symptom. You don't cure diseases by treating the symptoms. 

Firstly, governments aren't households. You cannot think about government debt in the same way you think about getting a loan from the bank to buy a new car. 

The dollar amount of a government's debt is not important. The last estimate is that Barbados' debt is 13,782.3 million Barbados dollars. That means nothing to me. 

Instead, we measure debt as a percentage of GDP. Remember that GDP represents Gross Domestic Production, and measures the value of goods and services a country produces. It's a measure of total economic activity. So we care about the debt-to-GDP ratio:

$$ Debt-to-GDP = \frac{Government \: Debt}{National \: GDP}$$

### Why is the debt-to-GDP ratio important? 
The government's ability to repay the money it has borrowed depends on how much economic activity is going on. The more you get paid, the more taxes the government collects. The more new businesses open, the more taxes they pay. It simply means that as more economic activity happens (the more we produce), the easier it is for government to repay the money it has borrowed. 

**This means that government borrowing can actually be a good thing.** 

> Suppose the government borrowing $100 million to build a new port. The new port brings ten new cruise ships to Barbados every week. This earns the government $120 million in fees from the cruise ships for docking, along with taxes paid on extra tours and restaurant meals that the additional tourists buy. The government repays that $100 million along with $10 million in interest. The government is still up $10 million, because the economy has grown enough to provide it with the taxes to repay the bill.

The simple rule that the government should always borrow to spend once the growth created by that additional spending is higher than the interest rate on that borrowing.

So what has made Barbados' debt-to-GDP ratio a problem? Is it that we simply borrowed more than we should have? No. The chart below shows that our debt kept rising at a consistent pace; there is nothing abnormal about it. The problem is that our GDP simply stopped increasing after 2008!

```{r debt, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=3.5, fig.align='center'}
dg <- read_excel("~/Box Sync/WSABE/debt and gdp.xlsx")
dg$GDP <- dg$GDP / 1000
dg$Debt <- dg$Debt - dg$Debt[1]
dg$GDP <- dg$GDP - dg$GDP[1]
dg <- melt(dg, id.vars="Year")

ggplot(dg, aes(x=Year, y=value, color=variable)) +

  theme(legend.position="none") +

```

How is this even remotely possible? I've already discussed the failure of productivity and creative destruction. Let's add another dimension to the debate. The problem is not **that** we've been borrowing to spend. The problem is **what** we've been borrowing to spend on. 

It matters enormously what you've been spending your money on. From 2009 onwards, the government drastically reduced the amount of its spending devoted to investment. Instead, we have been dedicating spending to unproductive activities like free summer camps or free bus fares. We have been borrowing to buy corn curls. 

```{r spending, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=3.5, fig.align='center'}
gov <- read_excel("~/Box Sync/WSABE/govt exp.xlsx")
gov$Year <- format(as.Date(gov$Quarter),"%Y")
gov <- gov[which(gov$Year<"2016"),]
gov <- gov %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise_all(sum)
gov$Capital <- gov$`Capital Expenditure`/(gov$`Current Expenditure`+gov$`Capital Expenditure`)
gov$RevSpend <- gov$Revenue/(gov$`Current Expenditure`+gov$`Capital Expenditure`)
gov <- gov %>% mutate(RevCh=(Revenue/lag(Revenue)))
#gov$RevCh <- gov$Revenue/gov$Revenue
govexp <- melt(gov, id.vars="Year", measure.vars = c("Capital"))
govexp$Year <- as.numeric(govexp$Year)
govexp$col <- ifelse(govexp$Year>2008,"A","B")
govrev <- melt(gov, id.vars="Year", measure.vars = c("RevCh"))
govrev$value <- govrev$value-1
govrev$Year <- as.numeric(govrev$Year)


#plot barchart
ggplot(govexp, aes(x=Year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=value, fill=col), stat="identity") +
  theme_tech(theme="google") +
  #scale_color_tech(theme="google")+
  scale_fill_tech(theme="google")+
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
    labs(x="Year", y="% of Total Spend", title="A Shift in Priorities", 
         subtitle="How Much of Government Spend is Investment?")
  #geom_line(data = govrev, aes(x=Year, y=value), size=1.5, color="#FFBF03")
```

> Let's stay with the port example. If the government decided to spend that $100 million hiring workers to file all of its old copies of ID card into new filing cabinets, is there any way that spending would result in returns of $110 million or more? Nope.

Every extra dollar spent on public investment increases GDP. In contrast, every extra dollar the government spends just paying bills actually reduces GDP. Worse, every dollar spent paying bills has a negative four times as large as the positive effect of spending on investment. 

The problem with having this discussion is that someone is always getting something when the government spends mony unproductively. If I say the government should stop spending money on corn curls, then someone will ask "well how should the corn curl man make a living?" That's not the question. The question is whether that extra dollar of spending is productive or not: does it have additional knock-on effects on economic activity or not?

So the next time you have a discussion, don't say that the government should stop borrowing or spending. Don't think about whether that government spending will benefit you personally. Instead, concern yourself with **what the government is spending on**. Concern yourself with whether that government spending will increase economic activity. Be interested in whether it benefits the country or not. Engage with the heart of the matter: where should the government be spending **our money?**
