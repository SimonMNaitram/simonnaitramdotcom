In my previous post, I was somewhat fuzzy about *where* productivity growth actually comes from. Today, I'm focusing on the main source (and most contentious source) of productivity growth: **creative destruction**.

What is creative destruction? Creative destruction is the non-stop innovative process where new firms with new products replace old firms. It is the destruction of outdated firms through the process of creativity. Over the long run, it's estimated that creative destruction accounts for over 50 per cent of productivity growth. 

Apart from creative destruction, there's another way we can think of productivity-generating creation of new products---through existing firms. Firms which already exist can innovate, create new products, replacing their own products but at better quality. This is actually the biggest channel for productivity growth Importantly, it isn't hard to see that this won't happen without the existence of creative destruction.

So how do we get this all-important creative destruction? It has to be enabled by regulation, institutions and a culture of innovation. The grimly titled book "Why Nations Fail" examines a series of example of cases where poor institutions (political, government, society) limit growth by wiping out the chance for creative destruction.

How does that happen? Well creative destruction implies that existing firms will be destroyed. Their owners don't want that, and owners/managers of corporations tend to be rich and powerful people, as are the firms themselves. Firms can provide financial incentives to creators of regulation to ensure that their firms are protected from outside challengers. It establishes their monopoly, their dominance, and restricts the process of creative destruction. 

Like everything in economics, however, creative destruction is not an absolute benefit. When one firm is destroyed, it means that its employees lose their jobs. Even within a company, innovation can result in outdated jobs being eliminated. What we do not see, however, is that the creation of a new company employs new and more people.

If the process of creative destruction is supported, constant innovation means that even if you lost your job today, you'd be able to find a new job in a new industry quickly since jobs are always being created. However, that takes a bit of faith that few of us have.
