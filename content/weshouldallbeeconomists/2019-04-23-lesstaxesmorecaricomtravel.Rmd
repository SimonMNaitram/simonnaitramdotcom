For a generation, the governments of the Caribbean have obstructed the Caribbean project. There is one single thing that would change the game. It would bring the whole stupid wall crashing down. 

**Remove taxes on travel within CARICOM.**

Taxes on inter-island travel make up exorbitant amounts of the cost of a ticket to travel within the Caribbean. Here's an outrageous example of how our governments *actively* obstruct the Caribbean project.

You say Caribbean people don't like one another. But how on earth can we like what we do not see? Xenophobia---the distrust of other Caribbean people---is a result of not being able to see, visit, and interact with other Caribbean people. And our governments have maintained this xenophobia because it benefits their petty power.

I do not care how much revenue governments will lose. This is not a game of dollars and cents. This is the story of the Caribbean people. Do you want history to write that Caribbean people hated one another for a century because our governments refused to let us travel?

Can you imagine taking a weekend to beautiful St Kitts, hopping to St Vincent for carnival, or visiting your aunt in Jamaica for a few days? I can. I do. But it does not exist while our governments impose *artificial barriers* on Caribbean people. 

If you want economic arguments, here they are. Take the existence of Redjet as an example. During the existence of Redjet with it's lower fares, the average growth rate of CARICOM tourists into Barbados jumped from 2.5% to 27%. That is a full order of magnitude. 

1. Tourism is our biggest earner. But tourism is highly seasonal. Caribbean people do not travel within the Caribbean because it is cheaper to travel outside the Caribbean. Reducing the price of inter-island travel will substantially increase inter-Caribbean tourism, and substantially reduce the wild volatility of our tourism industries that require us to wait until it snows in the North.

2. Cruise tourism is enormous business. Any clue why? Because it is a cheap and easy way to see lots of Caribbean countries in one go. But we get almost none of the money from that. Cheap inter-island travel would make island-hopping easy, and we would get an increased number of multi-island visitors actually staying on land in our hotels rather than cruising around on a ship we don't own.

3. LIAT's threatened existence is not the result of poor management. Do not accept this lie. A small fledgling airline cannot succeed in an industry where taxes on its product can be over 200%. There is nothing LIAT can possibly do to reduce its prices low enough to make people want to travel. Our governments blame LIAT, when truly they are the only ones at fault.

4. Oddly, taxes on inter-island travel are so high that they are likely beyond the revenue-maximising point. That is, by reducing taxes, so many more people would travel that the increase in the number of people travelling would offset the lower tax rates. The government would likely make *more* money. 

This is no longer a matter for discussion. There are no 'pros and cons' to debate. The Caribbean project is far bigger and far greater than our petty squabbles, and far more important than a few dollars in the government's coffers.
