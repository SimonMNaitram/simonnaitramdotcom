<p>Diversify!</p>
<p>Stop putting all your eggs in one basket!</p>
<p>Venture into new forms of business. Don’t invest in one thing.</p>
<p>This is great advice for large economies. But is it useful for small economies?</p>
<p>It depends on how you view the world. There are two perceptions of how businesses work.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>As you increase the size of your business, <em>average costs increase</em></li>
<li>As you increase the size of your business, <em>average costs decrease</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Which one do you think it is? Do you think that the bakery around the corner can produce bread at a lower cost per loaf than Purity? Do you think you can distill rum in your backyard cheaper than Foursquare?</p>
<p>Economists love to <em>teach</em> increasing average cost because its simple. But the busines world <em>knows</em> the truth is that average costs decrease as your business grows. That’s why Walmart can sell you stuff at next to nothing.</p>
<p>And that’s why businesses in small countries have a hard time cracking international markets. You have to grow your business <em>first</em> so that your costs can fall far enough so that you can then compete with big businesses on the international market. Exporting isn’t easy.</p>
<p>So is diversification good? Should we be investing all our time and energy in different businesses and different pursuits? Or should we all focus on one industry—one firm even?</p>
<p>Crazy thought. What if all of Barbados worked for a company like Apple. They employ 130,000 people—less than the population of Barbados. But their revenue per year is 265.6 billion USD. Their net income is 59.53 billion USD. Barbados’ total GDP per year is 4.797 billion USD.</p>
<p>If Apple was the only company in Barbados, we’d make 59.53 billion per year in net income. That’s an average income per capita of $200,000 USD.</p>
<p>Unrealistic, sure. But just an example of the difference between employing your resources in lots and lots of really small businesses versus employing your resources in a single venture. The reason for this difference? A little thing economists like to call <strong>economies of scale</strong>. As your company grows in size, your cost falls, you can sell more, you can dominate the market, you can become hugely profitable.</p>
<p>Obviously I’m not advocating for everyone working for a single company. But I’m advocating for us creating big businesses in Barbados that have the potential to truly compete on the world stage. There’s no reason we can’t create large manufacturing or research or services companies that can be globally successful. Size only matters if you’re trying to spread your resources across a whole bunch of ideas. So let’s find a goose and milk it for all the golden eggs it can give us.</p>
