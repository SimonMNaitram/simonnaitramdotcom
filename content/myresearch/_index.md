I argue that the corporate income tax is justified by the benefit view of taxation---that firms should pay tax according to the benefits they receive from using public inputs. Benefit-based taxation of firms is fair, both within and across countries. I derive a formula for the optimal benefit-based corporate tax rate. It is a function of two estimable elasticities: the public input elasticity of profits and the (net of) tax elasticity of profits. I empirically apply this formula to public firms in the United States, finding an optimal tax rate in the region of 35 to 59 percent.

In this paper I estimate the size of strategic spillovers from corporate tax competition. Existing evidence suggests that the revenue loss due to strategic spillovers is substantial. A three-country, three-firm model of tax competition predicts that the relative size of a government's optimal response to a neighbour's tax cut depends on the size of the capital flows induced by the neighbour's tax cut. I use this theoretical prediction to empirically identify the size of strategic spillovers. Using data on bilateral cross-country capital stocks to weight the average foreign tax rate, I find that governments respond to a 1 percentage point cut in the foreign tax rate with a 0.23 percentage point cut of their own. This estimate is a third of the size of previous estimates. This paper suggests that revenue loss from tax competition is modest compared to previous estimates.
