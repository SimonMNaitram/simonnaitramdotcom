I'm Simon Naitram, a PhD economics candidate at the University of Glasgow. I'm Barbadian, with a deep love for everything Caribbean. I chose economics because I want to make a real difference to the everyday lives of normal people.

Unfortunately, however, I'm forced to spend most of my time coding in R, fiddling with data, and playing with Latex. The rest of the time I'm reading about, playing, or watching cricket. Boring, I know.

So to begin making a difference, I've started this blog to meet the need for a broader, more public debate on economics, particularly in the Caribbean. I'm not just finding new and exciting ways to procrastinate,Â I promise.

Each post will be part of a conversation with you, and a thoughtful response to your comments and questions. I may not frequently respond directly to comments, but I encourage you to engage with the debate as I read them all. This feedback process drives the conversation forward, and allows my views to evolve with new evidence.

I hope you find this blog enlightening and fascinating. And I hope it can have at least a smidgen of an impact on our society. Happy reading!
