I'm Simon Naitram, Assistant Lecturer and the University of the West Indies and PhD in Economics candidate at the University of Glasgow. I'm Barbadian, with a deep love for everything Caribbean. I chose economics because I want to make a real difference to the everyday lives of normal people.

To begin making a difference, I've started this blog to meet the need for a broader, more public debate on economics particularly in the Caribbean. I'm not just finding new and exciting ways to procrastinate, I promise.

Each post will be part of a conversation with you, and a thoughtful response to your comments and questions. I encourage you to engage with the debate. This feedback process drives the conversation forward, and allows my views to evolve with new evidence.

I hope you find this blog enlightening and fascinating. And I hope it can have a substantial impact on our society. Happy reading!
